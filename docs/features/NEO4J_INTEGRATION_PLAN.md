# Neo4j + pgvector Hybrid RAG Integration

## 🎯 Architecture Overview

```
User Query
    ↓
1. Semantic Search (pgvector) → Top similar chunks
    ↓
2. Graph Expansion (Neo4j) → Related entities, concepts, documents
    ↓
3. Context Fusion → Enhanced, contextual results
    ↓
4. LLM Generation → Better, more informed responses
```

## 🏗️ Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Neo4j Setup & Entity Extraction
- Install Neo4j and neo4j driver
- Extract entities from PDF text (NER)
- Create knowledge graph nodes and relationships

### Phase 2: Hybrid Service Layer
- Combine vector search + graph traversal
- Implement smart retrieval strategies
- Context ranking and fusion

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- Document relationship mapping
- Concept clustering
- Multi-hop reasoning

## 📊 Benefits for RAG

### Current (pgvector only):
- Query: "AI regulations" 
- Returns: Similar text chunks about AI regulations

### Enhanced (pgvector + Neo4j):
- Query: "AI regulations"
- Returns: 
  * Similar chunks (pgvector)
  * Related legislation (Neo4j relationships)
  * Connected companies/entities (Neo4j graph)
  * Cross-document references (Neo4j connections)

## 🔧 Technical Stack

- **Vector Search**: PostgreSQL + pgvector
- **Graph Database**: Neo4j
- **Entity Extraction**: spaCy or OpenAI API
- **Orchestration**: New HybridRAGService class

## 🚀 Implementation Steps

1. **Setup Neo4j**: Docker container + driver
2. **Entity Extraction**: From PDF text during upload
3. **Graph Building**: Create nodes and relationships
4. **Hybrid Search**: Combine vector + graph results
5. **Context Fusion**: Smart merging of results

## 📈 Expected Improvements

- **Precision**: 30-50% better relevant results
- **Context**: Multi-document connections
- **Relationships**: Entity-based discovery
- **Reasoning**: Multi-hop question answering
